				<h3>Why we do BBQ better</h3>
				<p>
					What allows us to achieve this perfection comes down to our unique spice rubs, the time we allow that meat to cook, 
					and a selection of sauces to satisfy any pallet from any region. We don't just want to be another barbecue joint or sports bar. 
					We want to deliver on our commitment and be the place you call YOUR barbecue joint and sports bar.
